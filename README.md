[![MeVitae](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MeVitae/Generate-X509-Certificate/master/Resources/Github%20Powered%20By%20MeVitae.png)](https://www.mevitae.com/)

Using powershell core 7 and .net core 3.1 for IdentityServer
(Certificates made using powershell 7 seem to export null private key, hence we use wincompat sessions to export)

This app is based on
